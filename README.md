## üìå Key Concepts

### What is EC2?
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable virtual servers in AWS.
- Offers full control over compute resources.
- Supports multiple instance types and OS options.

### EC2 Use Cases
- Web hosting, dev/test environments, machine learning, batch jobs, etc.

### Instance Families
| Family | Optimized For | Examples |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| t3, m6i | General purpose | Web servers, dev |
| c7g    | Compute         | ML inference, API servers |
| r6g    | Memory          | In-memory DBs |
| i4i    | Storage         | NoSQL, data lakes |
| p4d    | GPU             | ML training, HPC |

### Pricing Models
| Model      | Use Case                         | Notes |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| On-Demand  | Unpredictable workloads          | No commitment |
| Reserved   | Steady-state apps (1‚Äì3 yrs)      | Up to 72% savings |
| Spot       | Fault-tolerant/batch processing  | Up to 90% savings, can be interrupted |

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Practice

### Step 1: Create Key Pair

# In AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Key Pairs
# Downloaded key: my-key.pem

### Step 2: Set File Permission
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b17d9de-fe71-4210-b42f-2ca4ba15c6f4)

# chmod 400 my-key.pem

### Step 3: Launch EC2 Instance

# AMI: Amazon Linux 2
# Instance Type: t2.micro
# Key Pair: my-key.pem
# Allow SSH (port 22) in security group

### Step 4: Connect via SSH

# ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-ip>

üß† Interview Notes
      chmod 400: Makes .pem file readable only by owner ‚Äì required for secure SSH.
      EC2 instances can be scaled, stopped, restarted, or terminated anytime.
      Always select correct region, key pair, and security group when launching.
